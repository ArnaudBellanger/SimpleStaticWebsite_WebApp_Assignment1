This is a simple static website made to learn the basic of HTML5 CSS3 (CSS grid) 

Table : The table can be found in the batrep.html page line 96
Liste : The list can be found on the project.html page line 71
Video : There is 2 videos in the tutorial.html page
gallery : one in galerie.html and one in tutorial.html (line 51) (where we can click to enlarge the images)

CSS3 element :
-background-size : index.html line 13
-text-shadow : page style.css line 41
-box-shadow : page style.css line 81
-transition : tutorial.css line 85, 103, 115

html5 element :
-article : tutorial.html line 35, project.html line 57
-footer : at the end of each pages, index.html line 110
-header : at the begining of each pages, index.html line 61
-nav : for the nav bar in all the pages, index.html line 66

positional content : I used float in the header for my title and for the navbar. style.css line 57 and line 65
I also used grid to make my tutorial.html page.

I explored aditional HTML and CSS features by watching youtube tutorials of html and CSS.
For example I mainly learn how to use CSS grid with this 2 videos :
